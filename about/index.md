# About Me

Hi! I'm Sean. In the past I attended NYU and the University of Maryland. I'm
currently a PhD student at the University of California San Diego.
I live in La Jolla, California where you can find me spending most of my time writing
code, taking pictures, and reading books. If you're interested in what I've been
reading lately see the [supplementary materials](supplementary-materials.html).
I also have a sub-blog called [Notes](http://seankross.com/notes/). If you want
the information on this page in a single document you can 
[download my CV](http://seankross.com/cv/).

# Work

I work in the [UC San Diego Design Lab](http://designlab.ucsd.edu/) where I'm advised by
[Philip Guo](http://pgbovine.net/). In the past I've
worked at the [Johns Hopkins Data Science Lab](http://jhudatascience.org/), the
[University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies](http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/),
and the
[New York University Center for Genomics & Systems Biology](http://cgsb.as.nyu.edu/page/home).

# Talks

- 2nd Year Qualifying Exam Talk. [Video](https://youtu.be/rihmaqI1ukw)
- Joint Statistical Meetings 2017, [Slides](http://seankross.com/jsm-talk/), [Blog Post](http://seankross.com/2017/08/11/Beyond-Axes-Simulating-Systems-with-Interactive-Graphics.html)
- Dataverse Community Meeting 2017, [Slides](http://seankross.com/iqss-talk/), [Blog Post](http://seankross.com/2017/06/19/Turning-Researcher-Fatigue-into-Puppy-Fatigue.html)
- The Computing Club at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health kindly invited
me to give a talk about a topic of my choosing so I rambled on about
interaction design for data and modeling. These slides are unexciting, they're
mostly links to amazing work other folks have done which I demonstrated as
a means to try to inspire the audience. [Slides here](http://seankross.com/data-interaction-talk/).
- I spoke to members of the GIS community at [The University of Pennsylvania's
Institute for Urban Design](http://penniur.upenn.edu/) at their GIS Day 2016
celebration. [Slides and notes here](https://github.com/seankross/gisday).
- I gave a talk about [swirl](http://swirlstats.com/) at the 2016 Seminario
Internacional de Estad√≠stica con R. [Slides here](http://seankross.com/notes/swirltalk/).
